# CONCEPT
<br>
Clocks or Multivibrators are sequential logic circuits that operate continuously between two distinct states of HIGH and LOW.
Astable â€“ A free-running multivibrator that has NO stable states but switches continuously between two states this action produces a train of square wave pulses at a fixed known frequency.

# PARTS INVOLVED

555 timer IC,
100k ohm resisor, 
1k ohm resistor,
1uF Capacitor x 3,
