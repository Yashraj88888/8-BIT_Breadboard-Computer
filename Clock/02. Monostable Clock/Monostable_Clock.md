# ✦ CONCEPT
<br>
Monostable – A one-shot multivibrator that has only ONE stable state as once externally triggered it returns back to its first stable state.

# ✦ PARTS INVOLVED

555 timer IC,
100k ohm resisor, 
1k ohm resistor,
1uF Capacitor x 3,
0.01 capacitor,
LED,
Potentiometer,
5v Powersupply ( we used a 5/3.3V Power supply module powered by a 9V battery ).
